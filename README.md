# Mindful UX Redesign: SLPOSTMate (Sri Lanka Post)
This repository contains the UX research, design documentation, and prototype for the redesign of the official Department of Posts Sri Lanka Android application. The project aims to transform a "database-style" interface into a user-centered digital service.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The current SLPOSTMate application provides essential services but suffers from significant usability barriers, including high cognitive load, "identical icon" traps, and broken user flows that redirect users to external browsers. Our redesign focuses on Mindful UX Principles to enhance trust, efficiency, and accessibility.

## 🛠️ Key Problems Identified

The "Stranger" Effect: No user onboarding or identity management, requiring repetitive manual data entry.
Cognitive Overload: Six dashboard buttons used identical icons, forcing users to read dense text every time.
Fragmentation: Core features like tracking and support redirected users out of the app to external websites.
Accessibility Issues: High-glare white UI (difficult for outdoor use) and small touch targets (difficult for elderly users).

## ✨ Proposed Solutions & Features
Structured Onboarding: New splash screens and language selection (English/Sinhala/Tamil) to welcome the user.
Secure Authentication: Integrated Sign-In/Sign-Up to save order history and addresses.
Integrated Customer Care: A breakthrough module featuring in-app live chat, hotline access, and image sharing for damaged parcel verification.
Modern Dashboard: Distinct, high-contrast iconography and a cohesive visual hierarchy.
Dark Mode/Outdoor Optimization: Redesigned theme to reduce glare for delivery riders and outdoor users.

## 👥 User Personas
We designed for a diverse range of Sri Lankan citizens:
The Entrepreneur: Needs quick postage calculation and distinct icons.
The Rural User: Needs minimal data entry and all-in-one tracking.
The Digital Native: Expects a modern UI similar to Uber/PickMe without redirects.
The Pensioner: Requires large text and non-high-contrast visuals.
The Delivery Rider: Requires safety-first UI with large buttons for use with gloves.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
We conducted Heuristic Evaluations and Thinking Aloud studies with five external evaluators.
Results: Participants completed tasks faster, reported lower confusion, and praised the new Customer Care module.
Refinements: Minor adjustments were made to button contrast and text alignment based on evaluator feedback.
